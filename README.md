Scenario:
You work for a small company that creates text-based games. You recently pitched your design ideas for a text-based adventure game to your team. 
Your team was impressed by all of your designs, and would like you to develop the game! 
You will be able to use the map and the pseudocode or flowcharts from your designs to help you develop the code for the game. 
In your code, you have been asked to include clear naming conventions for functions, variables, and so on, along with in-line comments. 
Not only will these help you keep track as you develop, but they will help your team read and understand your code. 
This will make it easier to adapt to other games in the future.

Recall that the game requires players to type in a command line prompt to move through the different rooms and get items from each room. 
The goal of the game is for the player to get all of the items before encountering the room that contains the villain. 
Each step of the game will require a text output to let the player know where they are in the game and an option of whether or not to obtain the item in each room.
